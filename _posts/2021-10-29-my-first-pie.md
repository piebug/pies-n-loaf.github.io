My first pie was an apple pie I made for Thanksgiving 2020. It was a Pandemic Pie&mdash;pre-COVID, I was much less interested in spending an entire day covered in flour, butter, and sweat. Quarantine awakened a part of me that needed to smash and mutilate my food in order to enjoy it.

So I made a pie. It was imperfect, but it was a pie. My pie. And I thought it was delicious. 

The progress pics, on the other hand, are disgusting. Raw dough covered in slimy egg is not appetizing.

Despite the sickly exterior, I knew the magic of baking would take care of things. I tossed the cadaverous monstrosity in the oven without fear.

...But did you know that pies can MELT?! I sure didn't. Not really. 

All the hours I spent watching the Great British Bake Off failed to prepare me for the horrifying dough-struction, but at least I knew the next step was to sigh dramatically and pray. So I cozied up with some scraps of cooked pie crust and a cat.

Eventually I heard the beeps of food.

It was a pie! It was stunning! It was also extremely sticky. Apparently dough liquifies and liquid _explodes_ when you bake pies.

I let the pie cool (miraculously exercising restraint after waiting all that time), and learned my third lesson: The apples shrink as much as a dysfunctional family in the '80s. The cute little pie windows became gaping, abyssal voids.

With faith, I finally cut in and ate my pie. I ate my pie for days. For weeks! And we lived happily ever after.
