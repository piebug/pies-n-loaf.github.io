My first pie was an apple pie I made for Thanksgiving 2020. It was a Pandemic Pie&mdash;I was much less interested in spending an entire day covered in flour, butter, and sweat pre-COVID.

But I did it! It was imperfect, but it was delicious! 

The progress pics, on the other hand, are disgusting. Raw dough covered in slimy egg is not appetizing.

Despite the sickly exterior, I knew the magic of baking would take care of me. I tossed the cadaverous monstrosity in the oven without fear.

...But did you know that pies can MELT?! I sure didn't. Not really. 

The expertise I gained watching the Great British Bake Off taught me that all I had left to do was sigh resignedly and pray. So I cozied up with some scraps of pie crust and a cat.

Eventually I heard the beeps of food.

It's a pie!! It's beautiful!! It's also extremely sticky. Apparently dough liquifies and liquid _explodes_ when you bake pies.

I let the pie cool (miraculously, after waiting all that time), and learned my third lesson: The apples shrink considerably. The cute little pie windows became gaping, abyssal voids.

With faith, I finally cut in and ate my pie. I ate my pie for days. For weeks! And we lived happily ever after.
