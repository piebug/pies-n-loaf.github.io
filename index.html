<h1>pie dough</h1>

<section class="site-intro">
  <p>
    hi, i’m sandy, a software engineer based in austin, tx.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    i love pie, but making it is a struggle. you need space, patience, and skill.
    as a baker and a small apartment renter, i have none of these things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    but you know what? i love pie.
  </p>

  <p>
    so i make it anyway, i mess it up, and i get better.
    i do this with software too. 
    as an engineer, i like to think my pie dough is light, flaky, and delicious.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “recipes” are projects and documentation i’ve written to learn new skills and build up my engineering cookbook.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “thoughts” are just that.
