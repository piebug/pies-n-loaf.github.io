<h1>pie dough</h1>

<section class="site-intro">
  <p>
    hi, i’m sandy, a software engineer based in austin, tx.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    i love pie, but making it is a struggle. you need space, patience, and skill.
    as a baker and a small-apartment-renter, i have none of these things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    but you know what? i love pie.
  </p>

  <p>
    so i make it anyway, i mess it up, and i get better.
    as an engineer, i don’t mess up nearly as often (there’s a reason this isn’t an actual baking blog),
    but i do make mistakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    i try things out, i experiment, i refactor, and i learn. 
    this is a process i cherish, and every project i work on benefits from it.
  </p>

  <p>
    i am an engineer who bakes her software. my ingredients are hand-selected,
    and my pie dough is light, flaky, and delicious.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “<a href="/recipes/">recipes</a>” are projects and documentation i’ve written to learn new skills and build up my engineering cookbook.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “<a href="/thoughts/">thoughts</a>” are just that.
  </p>
